# Grocery Stores
One api wrapper for multiple grocery stores. Delivering data within a standard format.

## About
This repository contains a api wrapper for multiple grocery stores. Currently only supporting apis of dutch grocery stores. The core structure of the code is based on the api wrappers that are made and maintained by [@RinseV](https://github.com/RinseV). These api wrappers are currently migrated into a single repository We are currently only supporting 5 different api's of dutch grocery stores (because of the 5 wrappes mady by [@RinseV](https://github.com/RinseV)), which will be expanded to support more api's of grocery stores once our first stable release is out.

## Beta Release
